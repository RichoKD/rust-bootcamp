// Static variables are allocated memory at compile time
// and their memory remains fixed throughout the entire program's execution.
// `Data Segment`
// PS: Underscore before a variable name typically indicates that the variable is intentionally unused.

// When a function is called, a stack frame is created on the call stack.
// This frame holds:
// - Local Variables
// - Function arguments
// - Return address

    // This makes them immutable by default.
    let _value: i32 = 12;
    // You can change what a variable is binded to by shadowing the variable
    let _value: u8 = 255;
    // You can make a variable mutable by specifying the `mut` keyword
    let mut _mutable: i32 = 10;
    _mutable = 20;

    // For Integers, the default type is i32
    // Unsigned: u8, u16, u32, u64, u128
    // Signed: i8, i16, i32, i64, i128
    // `&` symbol refers to Referencing, taking a pointer reference
    // `*` symbol refers to Dereferencing, accesing the value behind the pointer.

    // but it's generally less efficient due to the overhead of memory management.
    // Heap allocated data return
    // - A Pointer to where the value is stored on the heap
    // - Capacity: The total amount of memory allocated for a data structure.
    // - Length:  The number of elements currently stored in a data structure.
    //
    // Aside: When the length of a data structure exceeds its capacity, a reallocation occurs.
    // This involves allocating a larger block of memory and copying the existing elements to the new block.
